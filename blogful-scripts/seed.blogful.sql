  ('Brexit''s back: the five issues that will shape science', 'Many researchers might wish they could forget about Brexit. 
  But they can‚Äôt. 
  The United Kingdom has left the European Union, and for the past ten months it has been in a ‚Äòtransition period‚Äô during which little changed. 
  On 1 January 2021, that will end, bringing changes to public life and policy ‚Äî including that governing research.
  UK and EU negotiators are still trying to agree a trade deal that will determine their future relationship, including issues that affect science. 
  But with only weeks left to make an agreement that can be approved in time, talks have stalled. 
  The alternative ‚Äòno deal‚Äô scenario is widely predicted to cause chaos, because regulations that control people, goods and services would change abruptly overnight.',

  'Responsive typography has been tried in the past with a slew of methods such as media queries and CSS calc().
  Here, we‚Äôre going to explore a different way to linearly scale text between a set of minimum and maximum sizes 
  as the viewport‚Äôs width increases, with the intent of making its behavior at different screen sizes more 
  predictable ‚Äî All in a single line of CSS, thanks to clamp().',

  ('I Wish I Never Learned to Code',
  'I write code for a living. You might say I‚Äôm a professional software engineer, but really software engineering is much more than just a profession‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs a lifestyle. 
  The hoodies, the ping pong, the endless snacks and soda‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all true. 
  And yet, as rewarding as this field can be, I have a confession to make:
  Sometimes I wish I never learned to code.

  Quirks
  Ever since I started learning to code, browsing the web has never been the same. 
  No longer can I simply accept the errors I encounter on other sites as I use them. 
  Whenever something strange happens, curiosity gets the best of me, and I have to open up the browser‚Äôs developer tools and start debugging.

  Cryptic error message when trying to submit a form? You‚Äôll find me delving into the JavaScript console looking for error messages, digging through the source code, and observing the network requests as they come and go. 
  UI looks a little bit outdated, or has a really good-looking page layout? Either way I‚Äôll be resizing my browser window just to see how well it handles screen size responsiveness. 
  Comic Sans as your font of choice? 
  I‚Äôll probably never trust you or your company ever again.',

  ('Why I''m Looking Forward to the 2027 iPhone',
  'Another year, another iPhone with minimal changes. Virtually identical to the 2017 design except for the flat edges, the iPhone 12 that Apple recently announced doesn‚Äôt surprise. 
  It pleases, but it doesn‚Äôt dazzle. 5G and a series of back magnets, 
  named MagSafe, complete the highlights of a device that will sell well, but that won‚Äôt do anything to push the envelope.
  Is there anything else Apple can do with the iPhone of the future? Of course: a high-frequency display, more and better cameras, eliminate ‚Äúthe notch‚Äù, resuscitate Touch ID‚Ä¶ all iterative improvements. 
  Fun for some, boring for most.
  Apple reached its peak sales for iPhone in 2017 and financial analysts predict that 2020 will see a new peak driven by the higher number of customers who haven‚Äôt upgraded since then, when iPhone X came out. 
  It will be interesting to see if this prediction becomes true amid the coronavirus pandemic, 
  which has left a big part of the world in severe economic hardship.',

  ('What is Abusability Testing and Why is it Necessary?',
  'What does the future of online social networks look like?  We have seen how the most powerful social media networks have endangered democracy and public health. While there are interesting conversations today about what decentralized social networks might bring to bear to our online social lives, 
  I want to raise a new approach that is critical to any product team -- particularly those building social features. 
  Introducing abusability testing
  To build better and safer, tech teams need abusability testing: a comprehensive process to test products‚Äô vulnerability to being abused. 

  Abusability testing draws from established approaches such as threat modeling and human-centered design. In addition to thinking about security vulnerabilities, 
  it asks product teams to consider users and their human vulnerabilities to psychological, social, and physical harms. It extends human-centered design and value-sensitive design to prioritize vulnerable communities ‚Äì people usually considered ‚Äúedge cases.‚Äù 
  Abusability testing challenges product teams to ask: ‚ÄúHow might we be under-serving or even harming some segments of the population?‚Äù

   ('How to Become a Full Stack Developer: 6 Essential Tips',
  'A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients.

  As one of the hottest topics for developers, the discussions have never stopped. On LinkedIn and Facebook, lots of people put their job title as a full stack developer. Besides, it seems that the ‚ÄúFull Stack‚Äù topic has already become a new job trend. An article on Medium has discussed the full stack designer getting both praise and blame. Some people think that the full stack is just a title, what he/she should focus on is the real personal ability and technology.

  Essentially, I think the discussion about the full stack is also a kind of argument relating to the all-rounder and expert in the IT industry, and debate on the depth and breadth of development skills.',
